# Sigma | EPQ
## What is this?
Sigma is the resultant app of my EPQ, a one year elective course taken along side the first year of A levels. Sigma itself was a social media app designed and created to determine the difficulty of creating a mobile app.
## Why is there no source code?
This is an unfortunate side effect of moving on from secondary school, my school email was terminated. This meant that all my old files that were stored on my school account's Google Drive and network storage have been lost, and that includes the source code of my app.
## What remains?
The final apk of Sigma has been perserved and is available as a release to download; however, it will not work. This is due to the reliance of Sigma on it's SQL database for posts and users, without these, the app doesn't have anything except an empty UI shell. 
The pdf is the main part of the EPQ that I produced; it answered the question I initially asked myself and does so in quite well detail. It also displays the process I went through to produce this app.
The powerpoint is a collection of slides that summarise the pdf. It was required for the EPQ, and I presented it infront of a panel of examiners, including the 2 teachers that guided our class through the EPQ.
